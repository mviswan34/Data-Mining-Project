[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the .9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin' Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper

Adele - Hello,"[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore

Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Adele - When We Were Young,"[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But, if by chance, you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie, you sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

You still look like a movie, you still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song

[Post-Chorus]
When we were young, when we were young
When we were young, when we were young

[Bridge]
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?

[Break]
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young
(When we were young, when we were young)
(When we were young, when we were young)
[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song

Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight

Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

[Produced by Pop & Oak and Sebastian Kole]

[Intro: Isaac Hayes]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So, tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
You might also like[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
[Bridge]
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here407Embed"

All the love that's here tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh
It's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
It seems like yesterday that I was nothin'
Then all of a sudden I'm a volcanic eruption
Then all of a sudden it's like spontaneous combustion
And I'm all up in your face, yelling ""Bitch, you can't tell me nothin'""
'Cause I came from the bottom, now everybody's watchin'
I said it was my time, now I'm who everybody's clockin'
And I'm just out here sprintin', I'm runnin' right through my vision
I'm trying to outrun my past, but still trying to defeat my limits
'Cause you only get one moment in this life to be great
And you give it your all, despite what it takes
And you never let 'em kill you, you take everything they give you
And throw it right fucking at 'em and tell 'em it doesn't build you
And, no, it don't ever break you and, no, it can't overtake you
Life's like a bed of roses, you take the thorns and you make do
Sometimes you have to hurt for the 'cause to be reached
But one day you'll be stronger than all that you beat
And you can say

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
I woke up one Sunday morning, stopped believing in Jesus
Stopped believing in churches, I stopped believing in preachers
I realized I was a teacher, not just one of the heathens
I'm going to destroy the fallacies, start creating believers
Start creating the leaders, tell them who should they follow
Nobody but themselves, especially if they hollow
Especially when they empty, and death reserved for fulfillment
You the only person alive that holds the key to your healing
So you take it and you run with it
And keep going even when your sun's hidden
Because the time we spend in darkness when the rain come
Is where we often find the light soon as the pain's done
There ain't no material things in the world
That can change the fact you feel alone
Despite the fact that it gets hard, you take it all and you still go
Take the sun and you still grow, lose your light and you still glow
I been there, I'm still here, and I know how you feel, so
[Chorus: Sia]
Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh
It's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky

So sing with me a battle cry
Sing with me a battle cry

Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
It's hard to explain my way of living to people who never lived it
A minute in my position filled with my opposition
To anybody not different fighting to stay the same
I got lives in my hands and I'm fighting to make 'em change
Couldn't accept responsibility, find somebody to blame
The emotions that I'm harboring 'bout to drive me insane
Tried to say ""Fuck everything,"" but I ain't have the heart to
Rarely had the heart to do a lot of things I ought to
So now I spit it for people who say their cords missing
Inspire life into anybody that's forfeiting
'Cause it's easy to keep pretending that there's nothing wrong
But it's harder to keep your head up and be fucking strong
So, now they telling me ""Go, Haze, they can't stop you
Heavyweight flow, if they can't lift you then they can't drop you
The pinnacle, if they can't reach you, then they can't top you
Man, they can't do anything, that you're about to""
[Chorus: Sia]
Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight

It's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Oh-oh, oh-oh

We don't wanna fight
So sing with me a battle cry
Sing with me a battle cry

Angel Haze - Chi ,"[Verse 1]
I need to know
That somehow forever is real
And we can grow through whatever we feel
We could be like rose petals, Olympic gold medals
Or pretend we're kids and run through like every field
See, it gets much deeper than we think
Cause sometimes, you don't just fall
It gets much deeper, and you sink
And you're immersed in its love, so nothing else seems to matter
Though there's wholeness in the moment
It's nothing for things to shatter
So, can we break it down to a science
If love is chemistry, then you and I could be its ions
If love is mostly strength, then you and I could be the iron
And we carry the weight 'til it hurts
Do anything to make this shit work
Cause love won't always be easy
I just promise my all when you need it
And you'd be on time when I need you
And we'd vow to always be see through cause
There's no progress without some digression
And love is boring without some aggression

[Hook]
Just believe that you and I are supposed to be together
Baby, put your hands up and we can reach forever
Just believe that you and I are supposed to be together
Put your fucking hands up

I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Hey, baby, we can make it, make it right

[Verse 2]
I need to know that somehow our destiny matters
And that you'll keep my heart intact if the rest of me shatters
And that the things that we endure, we'll effectively master
Baby, this is food for thought off of destiny's platter
See, it takes some pain to make it work
Although diversion could occur, it takes some rock to make it Earth
I need to know that I'm safe within your grasp
And if ever I'm off, that you would race to keep me on track
Cause I would crack the clouds open just to show you heaven
And lift you up when you get down just to show you leverage
And if you've never felt love, I'll make it tangible
And show you how to do it right, I could be the manual

[Hook]
I just believe that you and I are supposed to be together
Baby, put your hands up and we can reach forever
Yeah, supposed to be together
Put your fucking hands up and we can reach forever

I don't mind, don't mind if everybody's far behind
Don't care if they can't understand the way
That you and I just want to be next to each other every day
You and I, we're just like magnets baby, hypnotized
Even addicted to your grumpy face
I know exactly just how many kisses fit between your eyes

[Chorus]
I'd run away, I'd run away with you
Would you run with me?
Our life could be a little bumpy, but I'd hold on
Just wanna tell you that I see you, baby, do you see me?
'Cause this is special, baby
Fuck 'em, only we know

[Verse 2]
Did I say you're all that matters to me anyway?
I'd give up everything to see your face
So come on, let's pretend that no one else is watching while we play
By your side, that's where I have to be now, we won't hide
I breathe your kisses just to stay alive
I see exactly what you're thinking, I can feel you with my eyes

BANKS - Trainwreck,"[Chorus]
Hey, I heard it from the state
They told me you were never gonna let me get away
And if you took me fishing, you would never give me bait
I had to get away, I had to get away, ay-ay
Hey, you try to compensate
For thinking with your one brain I should decapitate
You showed me all your letters that I should've confiscated
Both of my eyes were weighted and I had to get away

[Verse 1]
Talking to ears that have been deaf for as long as I can remember
A self-medicated handicap, so I speak to myself
And I try so hard to get his stupid deaf ears to hear
That I've become illiterate, I've become dumb

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I come through, you were dark blue
And I saved you from your darker days
Born to take care of you, or I thought so
Maybe it was just a phase

Hey, I heard it from the state

Shot down by a guy I never wanted to kiss
And I can hear the singing of his ringing triumphing
And I'm chugging along in a train
And I'm heading the wrong way, and I'm a trainwreck

To the music of this sad, same song
It's quite depressing
There is no fixing to the problem when you're talking to an idiot

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I come through, you were dark blue
And I saved you, from your darker days
Born to take care of you, or I thought so
Maybe it was just a phase
Baby, only maybe
Just a dreamer, but I soon found out
That the train tracks were behind me
Tried to warn me, but both of my ears went out

Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari (rrr, woo)

Meine Gang regiert den Plaza, alle meine Jungs sind on fuego
Was für Hahn im Korb? Ich seh' maximal nur Calimeros
Gangster schweigen und genießen, also quatsch mir nicht, Pendejo
Denn ein Rückgrat ist mehr wert als die Taschen voll Dinero
Geld kommt, Geld geht, aber Familie bleibt
Der innere Kreis elitär und klein
Auch wenn der Teufel viele Gesichter zeigt
Gott sei Dank nicht meins (meins)
Jeder testet, jeder redet, jeder schneidet sich ins Fleisch
Ich halt' meine Leute, halt' meine Ziele, meine Versprechen immer ein (ein)
Courage über Fame (Fame)
Und lieber Wölfe, die noch beißen, als die Köter, die nur bell'n
Klasse über Geld

Carlos Vives - Al Filo de Tu Amor,"[Letra de ""Al Filo De Tu Amor""]

[Verso 1]
No quisiste contestarme nada
Ni siquiera hiciste una llamada
Me borraste de tus listas en el chat

Te confieso que perdí la calma
Tu silencio me dolió en el alma
Ya no sé cómo ni cuándo si no estás
(Ya no sé cómo ni cuándo si no estás)

[Pre-coro]
No voy a molestarte nena
Porque nada quiero para mí
No has de saber mi amor que estoy así

[Coro]
Enamorado
Buscándote en todos lados
Sin señas, sin un recado
Abandonado, viviendo al filo de tu amor
Enamorado
Dispuesto y apasionado
Buscando para el mercado
Desempleado y pasando filo por tu amor
Enamorado

Escucha Nueva York que te estoy cantando
La historia de un amor que llegó acabando
Arrasando esto se fue llevando
Como Colón conquistando
Escucha el corazón que estamos bailando
Tu cuerpo es un imán que me va jalando
Como volando hacia tus caderas
Como una tromba chupando

Ya está llegando la noche
En la tierra del olvido
La tarde se está apagando
Como un piso encendido
Que no se acabe la fiesta
Si estás bailando conmigo
En la ciudad que no duerme
Déjame dormir contigo

[Verso 2]
Me perdonas si llego a estas horas
Pero salgo tarde en la emisora
Y pensé: ""¿qué tal si paso por allá?""

No voy a molestarte nena

Cascada - Everytime We Touch,"[Verse 1]
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream)
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you, it's hard to survive

[Chorus]
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry)
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

[Chorus]
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life

Catey Shaw - Night Go Slow,"[Verse 1]
The cars all stop where they are
When you take my hand, there is no time
Every moment that passes by with you
I wish I could rewind
Let go of your ways
And forget today
Just follow me tonight
Do you understand why I put all my plans on hold?

[Chorus]
And doesn't the night go slow?
When we are here alone
Something inside you shows
Ooohooh
Doesn't the night go slow?
Ooohoh. Slooooowoh. Oooooohoh

[Verse 2]
It feels like we are the only two people that left in town
Our phones are dead and the planes overhead
Don't even make a sound
With no distractions my only reaction to you is the joy I found
And I don't think I can let this moment go

And doesn't the night go slow?
When we are here alone
Something inside you shows
Ooohooh
Doesn't the night go slow?

Accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of

You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""?

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones

They pull you in to feel your heartbeat

Boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes

Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

[Verse 2]
Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes

Pretending that I need a boy

Dua Lipa - Garden,"[Verse 1]
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?

[Chorus 1]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?

[Verse 2]
Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

[Chorus 2]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it’s hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden

Ed Sheeran - Castle on the Hill,"[Verse 1]
When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown

Ed Sheeran - Galway Girl,"[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above

Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)

"G-Eazy - Me, Myself & I","202 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisMe, Myself & I Lyrics[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & G-Eazy]
Ooh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life (Yeah)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul (Ah)
[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
'Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends!
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends, yeah

Ooh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life (Got me for life, yeah)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul
[Post-Chorus: Bebe Rexha & G-Eazy]
I don't need anything (Yeah) to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (You know)
'Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time (Every time)
[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, and I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go apeshit
Say ""Fuck y'all!"" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it — tell me now, isn't it funny? (Nah)
[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & G-Eazy]
Ooh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life (Got me for life, yeah)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul
[Post-Chorus: Bebe Rexha & G-Eazy]
I don't need anything (Yeah) to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (You know)
‘Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time

'Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time
[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake
Pray to Lord my soul to take
My heart's become too cold to break
Know I'm great, but I'm broke as hell
Havin' dreams that I'm foldin' cake
All my life I've been told to wait
But I'ma get it now, yeah, it's no debate
Yeah
[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & G-Eazy]
Ooh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die

둘 사이 예쁜 기억이 ay

"gnash - i hate u, i love u ","[Verse 1: Olivia O'Brien]
Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song
[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien  with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you

Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissin' him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's callin' me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the Garden State
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me

We'll always be together, cross my heart
We'll always be together, cross my heart

I met a boy who would come undone
In love with a girl and a ghost of one

He heart was a house that was up and done
With no one to haunt it, just you if you want it

I met a girl with a question mark
Sick on the sadness that she drank up

Cause when you're a baby it's always true love
You're drunk or you're sober, you leave when it's over

We'll always be together, cross my heart

Nervous at night, cause it turned out wrong
Walking away from it all, all

Jonas Blue - Fast Car,"[Intro]
Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car

Jonas Blue - Perfect Strangers,"[Verse 1]
You were looking at me like you wanted to stay
When I saw you yesterday
I'm not wasting your time, I'm not playing no games

[Pre-Chorus]
Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?
We don't really need to know
'Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go

[Chorus]
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us

When I'm down, I get real down
When I'm high, I don't come down
And I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I could leave you just as fast

[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself

Justin Bieber - Sorry,"[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Ayy, yo
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down245Embed"

I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris

Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded

There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplyin' ten
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' round the city, you know what it is

Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she 'round me, she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl, I'm sorry
You just high yella, you not that important
Weight, shape her, I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tartar, I'ma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

A little time and some tenderness

No other! There's no other!
And a heart that's real and a heart that's true
Something that you've got to love this girl

Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (""Louder!"")

Lana Del Rey - National Anthem,"[Video Prelude]
[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?"" He said, ""Yes"" (Yes, yes)

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem while I am standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(""Yes, of course I will, my darling"")

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
[Verse 3]
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Outro]
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome

Lana Del Rey - Off To The Races,"[Verse 1]
My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

[Refrain]
Swimming pool, glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone

[Refrain]
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont, slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
[Chorus 2]
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

[Bridge]
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""
[Chorus 3]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down and now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

[Outro]
You are my one true love350Embed"

Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Lana Del Rey - This Is What Makes Us Girls,"[Verse 1]
Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneakin' out, lookin' for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walkin' down the streets as they whistle, ""Hi, hi""
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
""Lana, how I hate those guys""

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen (Happen, happen)

And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job
With the boss
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive
Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmering, we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', ""Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot""
(C'mon, take a shot)

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen (Happen, happen)
[Bridge]
The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was wavin' on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never comin' back

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him

Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it

It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater

And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life

But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

Except when they're praying away the things they need to shame
And some young people say they aren't hypocrites
Say that they accept everyone and they help us all

Lukas Graham - 7 Years,"[Chorus]
Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus]
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

[Bridge]
Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

[Chorus]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
[Breakdown]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

Always high

Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen

Losin' our religion

That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors

MARINA - Teen Idle,"[Verse 1]
I wanna be a bottle blonde
I don't know why but I feel conned
I wanna be an idle teen
I wish I hadn't been so clean
I wanna stay inside all day
I want the world to go away
I want blood, guts and chocolate cake
I wanna be a real fake

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wish I'd been a
Wish I'd been a teen, teen idle
Wish I'd been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible

The wasted years, the wasted youth
The pretty lies, the ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find I've come alive
[Verse 2]
I wanna be a virgin pure
A 21st century whore
I want back my virginity
So I can feel infinity
I wanna drink until I ache

I'm gonna puke it anyway

Ain't youth meant to be beautiful?

Why we keep coming back for more

MGMT - Little Dark Age,"[Verse 1]
Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
The ruins of the dead painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time

[Chorus 1]
Oh-oh
Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone
On the stage, my little dark age

[Verse 2]
Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

[Chorus 2]
Oh-oh
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age

All alone, horrified
On the stage, my little dark age

Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind

[Verse 4]
Policemen swear to God, love's seeping from the guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed, come find us heading
For the bridge, bring a stone
All the rage, my little dark age

I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing

Mike Posner - I Took A Pill In Ibiza - Seeb Remix,"[Verse 1]
I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older

I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone

Miley Cyrus - Malibu,"[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

Diablo, mi loco, pusiste un huevo de nuevo
Fre'queando con el Mayweather lominero
Primero tiene' que pararte del suelo pa' pode' rematarte
Como la perra habladora que tú ere' (No va' pa'l cielo)
Perro callejero, tú metío' en el estudio tirándome
Y tu ex mujer por DM me tiró primero
Cállate la boca, gordo chueco, segundero
Que lo único que puse a baila' fue tu lengua en mi guebo
Mira cómo este animal rompe el instrumental
Mientra' tú sigue' siendo la vergüenza urbana nacional
Fue que bajé muy letal; Natti Natasha, criminal
Aquí nadie quiere tus raya', guaremate universal
Tú no tiene' identida', en tu música se siente
Un día canta como Yankee, el otro como Residente
Arca te mando pa'l ca', ¿cómo se siente?
Y tú quiere' seguir viviendo de la pena de la gente
Ni en lo' clasico' de Roll And Play lo' domingo' te ponen
Tú ere' un TBT que ya ni lo' jueve' lo' suben
Mi música sigue rompiendo to' lo' kitipone'
Y tú siempre mendigando, llorando pa' que te ayuden
Tú ere' de mentira, chilindrina, tú ere' fake
Siempre pordiosero, tú nunca llegaste a rey
Se te fue la lu' en Noche de Luz

Princess Nokia - Goth Kid,"[Chorus]
I’m goth as fuck, even when I’m not in black
Gothic is the pain you feel and not the clothes that’s on your back
Don’t give a fuck about the fun you make of me
I’m not the type to play your role so get the fuck away from me
You make me sick and all I was was just a kid
You picked a flaw in all I did and go and make me feel like shit
I swear to God, you have no clue to how I lived
In foster care, abused as kids

[Verse 1]
Playing under my desk, a comic book in my bed
I fuck with Emily Strange and I got pins in my bag
I’m Wednesday Addams to you basic ass hoes
Marilyn Manson to you corny ass bros
I was sleepin' in the cemetery
Kinda cute, a little scary, goth as fuck, a little Carrie
You don’t know shit about me
You go assume and doubt me, I’m just like Ginger Foutley
The world was born of innies, and I was born an outie
You gonna see a side of me that you've never seen
My mind is kinda sick, and my jokes a little mean
Just a little gory, like a bloody fuckin' spleen
I been hangin' out with prostitutes and fiends

Trippin' hard, I try to breathe
Trippin' hard, I go to sleep
It’s a dirty game, and I’m nobody’s fool
I’d rather be myself, pretend I’m fuckin' cool
I’d rather be at home, than party where there’s hate
People makin' fun of me while smilin' in my face
I’m a nice kid and the world ain't
Got the knapsack and a fat sack
Said I’m gonna quit today, ha ha, fat chance
And at first glance, I’m so small and cute
Haven’t seen me pukin', drunk on my own shoes

Don't blame you every time you run away from me

Rina Sawayama - Cyber Stockholm Syndrome,"[Verse 1]
Girl in the corner, stirring her soda
Biting the shit out of her straw
Ready to go out, only her body tells her no
Pretty but sad inside, isn't she beautiful?
Queen of the ball even when she's home alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And she said
I'm not here for love tonight
The way you touch just don't feel right
Used to feelin' things so cold
Minimizin' windows
Pictures lit by electric lights
Fiction, fact, boundaries collide
Find me in my palm so bright
Cyber Stockholm Syndrome

[Chorus 1]
Came here on my own, party on my phone
Came here on my own but I start to feel alone
Better late than never, so I'll be alright
Happiest whenever I'm with you online

Better together
Ever the overrated touch
I am connected, I am the girl you want to watch
Lips full of glitter glow, spinnin' like mirror-balls

Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl

She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl

Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

Ruth B. - Lost Boy,"[Verse 1]
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

[Chorus]
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

[Verse 2]
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart

You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

Snakehips - All My Friends ,"[Intro: Tinashe]
Uh-huh, hoo

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure, I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bitter, brown salt, stinging on my tongue, ah
Heart will not waver, heart will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn
Burn your love into the ground with the lips of another
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely sometimes
[Chorus: Tinashe & Snakehips]
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I hate the bar (IGH!)
Pharmacy addict, hear the Wall Street traffic
Took the car (IGH!)
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it—skrrrt!
Crash on the floor, catch the z-z-z's (Hunh)
Popping the polar opposite of NZT (Hunh)
Hip-hop and the propaganda say they name-brand (Name-brand)
But I done seen how the *censored* did my main man (Main man)
The nights we won't remember are the nights we won't remember (IGH!)
I'll be gone 'til November, all my city call for Simba (IGH!)
Dreams are made for cages, nigga, lions are for real
Nigga, dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills (Woo!)
Nigga, fridays are for chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest-in-peace the recipe
The rest of us are prayin' that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying

Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely, some nights
When the angels on my shoulder slumber and I'm stuck here
With the vultures, hissing and circling
You didn't call me (Call me, call me, call me)

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe & Chance the Rapper]
Ooh, I'm crawling, crawling
Crawling back to you (IGH!)

[Chorus: Tinashe & Snakehips, Chance the Rapper, & All]

Son Dam Bi - Crazy ,"[Verse 1: Basick]
Yeah
B. A S I. C K. back in the game
My name that was forgotten 3 years ago
I’m gonna brightly let it be known to the world

Shoes, hat, kids who only care about outer swag, I’m gonna own them
Put down the mic, why are you throwing away the only fame you have?

Cuz you know uh I don't give a fuck
Fuck what you heard uh
Tell all the bastards who show off instead of doing music

You’re disgusting, your odor is so strong
What exactly did you do? Why you pretending to be real? Fuck that
Just remember this, now you fuckin’ with a family man
You know what the real match is? Don’t have to say it twice, it’s rap man

Put down the things that explode without rest, that make your face red
That dim your heart lights, that scratch the fans’ inside
Your existence ruins the others, your existence is damaging
Where are the real ones? Bring them all to me

Woah
Still representing Jiggy Fellaz
JF for life

Jiggy Boyz, swag, you can’t chase us cuz we’re like Usain Bolt
They talk about swag only by looking at my back
Cool clothes, cool car, money in my hands, pretty girls
You can smear all that stuff on the outside
But you and I are like 18k and a mine
You tattletale like a girl
When I kick yo mutha fuckin' ass
You’re like veal on top a fire, shitting blood
If I get sick with you, I’ll get healed in a day
But if I’m a sickness, I’m incurable
If rap is a game, my tongue is a foul
If I’m alcohol in this feast, I’m drunk
Every one of my actions is the shit
My eyes, my nose, my lips are all the shit
My rap, my track, a match for a hundred flow
It’s all the shit so you idiots lay low
My plan is for tomorrow, this is hot shit
If you can’t feel it then rewind, I’m confident
You won’t ever be fake in front of me again
My tongue is a bloodthirsty felon
The moment you think you saw my best
You’ll have to surpass it hundred times
You won’t be able to figure it out
You’ll listen with your ears but your eyes will pop out
Your pupils are growing
I’m the public enemy
The only thing I’ve done wrong
Is to be flowing with swag like a girlfriend whose been dumped
I’m crazy like Son Dam Bi
BAS haters, swag flowing even from my place of birth
It’s been 8 years since I bought my mic fuckers
You saw it too right, Basick’s swag

I don't mean to reproach you by saying this
I know that scares you
All of the big occasions you might have missed
No, I accept you
And I don't even need to know your reasons

I think you sometimes forget
I would know you best
I hope you don't take this the wrong way
But I think your inside is your best side

I, was that a teardrop in your eye?
I never thought I'd see you cry
Just know whatever hurts, it's all mine
It's okay to cry (It's okay to cry)
I can see the truth through all the lies
And even after all this time
Just know you've got nothing to hide
It's okay to cry (It's okay to cry)
It's okay to cry (It's okay to cry)
It's okay to cry (It's okay to cry)

I remember one time you were lost
I came to find you

Wish I could have said this

To get away from your parents

Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?""

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Therion - La Maritza,"La Maritza c'est ma rivière
Comme la Seine est la tienne
Mais il n'y a que mon père
Maintenant qui s'en souvienne
Quelquefois

De mes dix premières années
Il ne me reste plus rien
Pas la plus pauvre poupée
Plus rien qu'un petit refrain
D'autrefois :
La la la la...

Tous les oiseaux de ma rivière
Nous chantaient la liberté
Moi je ne comprenais guère
Mais mon père, lui, savait
Ecouter

Quand l'horizon s'est fait trop noir
Tous les oiseaux sont partis
Sur les chemins de l'espoir
Et nous on les a suivis
A Paris

{Parlé}
De mes dix premières années
Il ne reste plus rien... rien

Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day, locked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

You'll never know  the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

A bullet for them, a bullet for you

See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight

Feel the world around me

When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways

Alec Benjamin-Different Kind Of Beautiful,"[Intro]
You're a different kind of beautiful, the kind that makes me scared
The kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not there
The kind that takes my breath away and leaves me without air
Maybe I'm delusional, you're just that kind of beautiful

[Verse 1]
I grab an hors d'oeuvre and head to the bar
I place an order, a tip in the jar
A couple of dollars I had in my car
I turn the corner and that's when I see
You in the corner there, starin' at me
Mind out of order and heart on my sleeve

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hopin' that I'd run into
You here, but now I'm stumblin'
And I can't seem to figure this out
Now I'm broken and I'm crumblin'
In the open and it's troublin'
But I see you and it fills me with doubt

[Chorus]
You're a different kind of beautiful, the kind that makes me scared
The kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not there
The kind that takes my breath away and leaves me without air
Maybe I'm delusional, you're just that kind of beautiful
Different kind of beautiful, the kind that makes me fear
The kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not here
The kind that takes my breath away every time you're near
Maybe I'm delusional, you're just that kind of beautiful (Beautiful)

I try to speak, but I can't find the words
Knees gettin' weak and my speech gettin' slurred
Hands feelin' heavy and vision is blurred (Oh-oh, no-no)
I don't even know what I wanted to say
Didn't expect to be feelin' this way
You turn your head and then you walk away (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hopin' that I'd run into
You here, but now I'm stumblin'
And I can't seem to figure this out
Now I'm broken and I'm crumblin'
In the open and it's troublin'
But I see you and it fills me with doubt

[Chorus]
You're a different kind of beautiful, the kind that makes me scared
The kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not there
The kind that takes my breath away and leaves me without air

"Bad Bunny, Bomba Estéreo-Ojitos Lindos","[Verse 1: Bomba Estéreo]
I have listened to my heart for a long time
And the days and months pass, thinking of your smell (Your smell, your smell)
The time has come to start reasoning
Before it's too late and I accidentally break in half (Break in half)

[Pre-Chorus: Bomba Estéreo]
Before the sun comes up, step on the gas
Even if you don't have a brake and lose control
It'll only be us two, you and I caressing each other
In the midst of time, not saying goodbye

And just look at me with those pretty eyes
'Cause with that, I am finе, today I have been reborn

I haven't hеld somebody's hand in a while
I haven't sent a ""Good morning, I love you"" in a while
But you've got me entangled, I got involved
I was on my own way and I got lost (Ayy, ayy)
My gaze changed when I saw your eyes (Your eyes)
Bye-bye to the booties, I didn't even say goodbye to them
I didn't look for you, no, we bumped into each other through our path

Baby, ich habe es schon erkannt, man merkt es, wenn du mich ansiehst
Dort, wo du noch nicht warst, du weißt, dass ich dich hinbringe
Und sag mir, was du trinken willst, denn du bist mein Baby
Und wer wird über uns sprechen, wenn wir uns nicht sehen lassen?

Und manchmal ist es Dolce, manchmal ist es Bulgari
Wenn ich es dir nach den Partys ausziehe

Damit ich dich verschlinge wie ein Tier
Wenn du nicht gekommen bist, werde ich auf dich warten
In meinem Bett und werde es feiern

Baby, du bist ein Mythos, dieser Hintern ist ein Geheimnis (-heimnis)
Du bist verrückt danach gefickt zu werden und ich danach ernst genommen zu werden
Und ich werde Gott bitten, es dir zu erklären
Dass du zu durchtrainiert bist, du hast die Würze
Du bist nicht beeindruckt von diesen Narren mit Geld
Was du willst, ist gefickt werdеn

Ich hoffe, ich habe Glück
Weil nicht jеder an dich rankommt
Aber ich werde mein Ding machen, damit du mit mir losziehen kannst
Du lässt den Club starren wie ein Museum, Mama, du bist Kunst
Und ich habe bezahlt, um dich zu sehen
Und es wird dir gefallen
Alles, was ich mit dir machen will, eh
Heute muss ich mit dir reden
Der Club starrt auf dich wie ein Museum, Mama, du bist Kunst
Ich hoffe, ich habe Glück

Eh-eh, ayy
Wenn du eine Story hochgeladen hast, dann nur, damit du Antworten bekommst (-kommst)
Wenn ich dir ein Feuer-Emoji geschickt habe, dann nur, weil du mich geil gemacht hast (Horny)

Wenn es bedeutet, dass ich es dir geben kann, ayy

Und wenn es endlich passiert, werden wir diesen Ort verlassen
Ich hoffe, du bist einverstanden, lass es uns tun

Zieh alles aus, ich will es jetzt sehen
Weil du im Trend liegst, ohne dafür zu arbeiten
Komm mit mir, wir können uns gegenseitig trinken

'Cause I haven't been the same ever since that night
You look at me and I start sweating
I feel like I can fly

[Chorus]
Baby, the high is starting to kick in
My world is fucked up and I feel perfect
Because you're here moving like that, don't stop
Baby, you're my drug, don't slow it down tonight
Bеcause the high is starting to kick in
My world is fucked up and I feel pеrfect
Because you're here moving like that, don't stop
Baby, you're my drug, don't slow it down tonight

That man of yours lost you due to negligence
And I don't believe in abstinence
Tonight in bed there'll be turbulence
How good you suck on it, I'll give you permanency
That pussy is the eminence
I have a license to give it to her
Ever since we went to Florence
She got meaner, but she hasn't lost her essence
No, no, from Carola
No, no, no, she's not alone
No, no, don't say ""Hi"" to her
Or you'll be another one in line
I like your attitude
I'm fan of that pussy (Mwah, mwah)
Besides the weed, the Xanax, the coke and the molly (Nothing else)
You're the one that controls me, ah (Ayy, hehe)

Perhaps today you're upset
But you have happiness inside

On the Urus ignoring the stop signs
I'll give it hard to you so I'll be beyond comparison
Ayy, careful with those jeans, 'cause they'll rip (Ayy)

I don't know if I'll see you again
Or if I'll get lost tomorrow
You're a player, you gave me a crossover
This time you played me, you gave me a game over

Let me know if you'll stay tomorrow
After the alarm goes off I'll give it to you

I went lookin' at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted
But it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care
It's been a couple years and, yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours

And now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me

And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me

Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know
That ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Mama's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
Lotta people know my name, I made a little change
But that don't mean nothin'

Billie Eilish-bad guy,"[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

Billie Eilish-everything i wanted,"[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
You might also like[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head

Billie Eilish-Happier Than Ever,"[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)

You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you (You, you)
I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew

[Pre-Chorus]
I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, a-a-a-ayy

Dime, beba
Fecha y hora y te paso a buscar
Yo le llego donde los demás tú sabes que no le llegan
Ruido de botellas de champán de las copas al brindar

El traje combina con la Mercede' granate

When we were young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A colorful miracle
Remember how everything was so beautiful?

[Verse 1]
I miss the old days when the skies were blue
I miss the long nights stayin' up with you
I miss the summer 'cause we were in it together
I miss my hometown, don't you miss it too?
Drivin' to nowhere, nothin' else to do
I miss the old days, I wish they lasted forever

[Chorus]
When we were young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A colorful miracle
Remember how everything was so beautiful?
Woah, when we were young, it seemed that life was so simple then
So innocent, infinite
Look at us now, it's so different, isn't it?

[Verse 2]
I miss the ocean, the hair across your face
The little moments before we moved away
And lookin' back now, we shoulda stayed there forever
And now we're over the moon and we're under the stars
Know where we've been and we know who we are
And even as time goes by, I'll always remember

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be (Yeah)
Senseless sight to see
Yeah
Senseless sight to see
Ayy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Feelin' young but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm outside, twenty-nine, G5, seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever hurt one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busy body
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep it on us anymore, it's with security

[Chorus: Drake, Travis Scott, Both]
I'm outside (Yeah), twenty-nine (Yeah), G5, seaside

Rollin' 84s, it ain't no safety
Ridin' rich and wavy
Gotta roll over to you, gotta get my release
Spread your legs downtown, as I'm goin' out to eat
Even hear the raw sounds when that raw got me in sleep (Oh, oh)
I'ma roll on 'em 'fore I ever let 'em roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in the harmony (Sick)
Worry, sick, I'm sick of worryin' (Sick, sick)
It's just the world we in, I'd rather bury them
I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (Yeah)
Early-mornin' shoulder rubs, the lawyer sounding celebrant (It's lit)
I'm never settlin', this shit get darker than my melanin (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
At the crib all by myself, this shit be cavin' in
Scrollin' through my call log, by emojis, how I'm savin' 'em
Them heart eyes, that peach one, my old ones, but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them (Yeah)
Purple demon face one push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (Break it)
And saved a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down (Let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' a event, I get it frequent
I'm make an expense, to me, it's just cents
I'm droppin' the top, not to feel the wind
I'm droppin' the top 'cause bro tryna spin
She droppin' her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company (Yeah, yeah)
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid (Oooh, ooh)
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin' me back (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Now follow my lead
Tell me what type of payment is that? (Oh, oh-oh), I put that on my kid
And my trust, yeah, it is what it is (Oh, oh)

Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

[Pre-Chorus]
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

[Chorus]
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

Ugh, you're a monster

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
You might also like[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
[Verse 3: Eminem]
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

[Chorus: Drake]
Həftəsonu işləyirəm, həmişəki kimi
Ayıq deyiləm yenə, həmişəki kimi
Oğlanlar bizi ötdüklərindən əmindirlər, özlərini çox dartırlar
Vergilərimi həll etmədim, beynim çöndü
Biləyimdəki Patek Virgil-dəndir
Oğlanlar bir dəfə bekar vaxtımda məni tutdular, hə, n'olsun?
Kimsə bölgəvi taradı, biz olsaydıq deyərdim
Rosewood-da malikanəm var, çox lüks şeydir

[Verse: Drake]
Sayılı günlərim qalıb dedilər, amma hər səhər əvvəlki kimi oyanıram
Bilirəm mesajlarımı görürsən, balam, nə olar, mənə nəsə yaz
Şərab qədəhdə, sənin sevgilin yaman pul hərisidir
Oğlanlar albomumun tarixini yönləndirməyə məcburdur
Qancıq, bu şöhrətdir, prim deyil
Bilmirəm məsələ nədir amma danışığına fikir ver
Civinin eqosu evinin 2 qatı boydadır
Bir söz deyə bilmərəm ona, belədir, neynim
Deməli olduğum şeyi dedim, etməli olduğum şeyi etdim
FBG-yə heç vaxt arxa çevirmədim
Biləyimdəki Patek-i Virgil düzəldib, həşəmətlidir
Nömrəmi sənə verərəm amma gic-gic şeylərdən ötrü məni dəng etmə

You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

I know that you started to feel what I feel
I could tell 'cause you took my hand by the wheel
But you couldn't dare to make it real
Oh, it's such a shame (You left it here)

I was just askin' you to take my hand
Just for a minute or a night

I keep it short with a bitch, Lord Farquaad
All the girls in the front row (Ayy)
All the girls at the barricade (Ayy)
All the girls that been waitin' all day, let your tongue hang out, fuck everything (Ayy)
If you came with a man (Yeah, yeah)
Let go of his hand (Let go of that shit)
Everybody in the suite, kickin' up they feet, stand up, bitch, dance (I see you)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
And all the guys in the back waitin' on the next track
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Cut your boy a lil' slack
Whip your lovin' on me
It's young Jack
[Chorus]
I'm vanilla, baby (I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down)
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby (But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby)
I get love in Detroit like Skilla Baby  (Whip your lovin' on me, baby)
And the thing about your boy is
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
That's right, that's right
Whip your lovin' on me, baby
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby1Embed"

She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she's so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's workin'
So what can I do? (Ooh)

When you're out of sight
In my mind

'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

[Verse 2]
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one

I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water

Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah

Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick

It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, ""What do you love?""
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much

Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

[Chorus]
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

Lewis Capaldi-Someone You Loved,"[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

And you're not here to get me through it all

Baby, I know you so well, I know it was to make me jealous
I won't tell you who, but they saw you crying for me
They saw you for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me tell you
It looks like he treats you well, that he's such a gentleman
But that won't change the fact that I was first
I know that you'll do well, but he doesn't love you like I love you

It could be that you're missing nothing, nothing apparently
Vacation in Hawaii, I congratulate you
What you're posting on Instagram is very cute
So that I see how you're doing, so that I see
It could be that you're missing nothing, nothing apparently
Vacation in Hawaii, I congratulate you
What you're posting on Instagram is very cute
So that I see how good you're doing, but you're doing badly
Because love isn't bought with anything

[Verse]
Lie to all your followers
Tell him that the times are better now
I don't think that you'll ignore me if I call you
'Cause after me, there won't be any more loves
You and I were one
We'd do it on an empty stomach before breakfast
We'd smoke hookah and I'd pass you the smoke
And now in this war no one wins
If you ask me, it's no one's fault
Sometimes problems can accumulate for people
Let me speak, please, don't interrupt me
If I did something bad, then forgive me
People will believe you, you play that role well
Baby, but you're not happy with him

Ando manejando por las calles que me besaste
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste

Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide

Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide, eh

Que me cuide de otra que se parezca a ti
No quiero caer como hice por ti
Ojalá te enamore, te haga lo mismo que me hiciste a mí
Tú me enseñaste a no amar a cualquiera

Astronaut

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy

She say that I'm cool (Damn straight)
I'm like, ""Yeah, that's true"" (That's true)
I believe in G-O-D (Ayy)
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb (Play me)
I'ma play her for fun (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah

And nobody close tried to stop it
Long as everybody gettin' paid, right?
Everything'll be okay, right?
I'm winnin', so nobody trippin'
Bet if I ever fall off, everybody go missin'
At night, I'm sittin' in a dark room thinkin'
Probably why I always end up drinkin'
Yes, I'm very depressed
How can somebody so blessed wanna slit they wrist?
Shit, I'd probably bleed out some Pinot
When they find me, I'm in Valentino, ayy

Noah Kahan-Stick Season,"[Verse 1]
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's COVID on the planes

[Chorus]
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

[Verse 2]
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh

Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri

I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities

Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk

El viento soba tu cabello
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

Me gusta tu boquita, ese labial rosita
Y cómo me besas a mí (Yeh)

Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus]
Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night

I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you

[Verse 1]
I can't fuck with nobody
I can't keep livin' like this, I can't
I tell her what it is and I tell her what it ain't
She know that I been all in her walls like I paint
Told her at times I wanna give you trust, but I can't
Bitch, I really got it out the mud, climbin' up the ranks
When they see me outside, I'm a high roller
I've been on a global jet, but nigga, I fly solo
And I got the Gucci splattered all on her knick-knacks
Fifty racks, I'm 'bout to break her off like a KitKat
And her purse got F's like the wheels on the 'Bach
I just fucked off a million, but I still got a sack
Shorty know that I'm the realest, she know I be speakin' facts
She know that I'm the same nigga that was pushin' 'Cat
She know I got the game, but I'm never gon' give it back
Every time that we fuck, I gotta run it back

Baby, I don't know if you speak any Spanish
If you understand when I say ""My love""
Making love without understanding each other is better
We just have to like each other
You want me to fall into temptations
Look how that accent
That you have makes me feel
I don't understand too much, but come here

[Chorus: Selena Gomez & Rauw Alejandro]
Dance, dance, dance with me
Dance, dance and I'll follow you
Come closer, come, get loose
Don't leave me without the desire to rеturn
So dance, dance, dance with mе
Dance, dance, I'll follow you
Kiss me just once
So I'll have a reason to see you again (Rauw)

[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro & Selena Gomez]
Sincerely, let's let this flow
Don't keep thinking about it
We have the whole night for you to show me everything you feel face to face
Smells to me like there's nothing innocent about you (Yah, yah)
How do I tell you I don't want to talk about love?
If it's with you, I have to think better
Chill out, leave it like that, I want to stay here
Come closer, come to me, come closer, come to me

Kiss me just once
So I'll have a reason to see you again (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Rauw Alejandro]
I'm gonna leave you my number
You just have to call when you miss me
I'll be there (Ooh-woo)
Baby, even if I'm far, woah-oh (Yeah!)
The girl's from a different city, but she likes my flow
I was curious and she stole a kiss from me
We don't have to talk to each other (Ayy)
If with just a look we understand each other, yeah (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Selena Gomez & Rauw Alejandro, Both]
I don't understand a lot, but dance, dance, dance with me

Taylor Swift-All Too Well 10 Minute Version Taylors Version From The Vault,"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)

At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)

Taylor Swift-Love Story Taylors Version,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case

To move to a place so far away

Ich bin ein echter Player, kein Rookie (Ah)

Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

[Bridge]
Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

[Outro]
Will never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Break down
Tear me up inside
When you break me down106Embed"

[Pre-Coro: Peso Pluma & Yng Lvcas]
Desafánate, loca, luego empápate
De mi cuerpo mójate, usted sabe, en el Benz,  móntate
¿Qué lo que? Mi bebé en el Mercedes Benz
Las estrellas en el techo, ya estelar se fue
Pero sabes tú que esta noche estás pa' mí
Ven, trépate encima 'e mí, manda la ubi, paso por ti

[Coro: Yng Lvcas]
Quierе que le ponga música
Pa' que bailе hasta abajo la bebé
Bebimos par de botellas
Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer
Quiere que le ponga música
Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé
Bebimos par de botellas
Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

[Verso 1: Yng Lvcas]
No se le ha olvidado cómo la pasamos
Fuimos a la disco y los dos bailamos pegados
Como perros pegados, besos y un par de tragos
Se quedó a mi lado y dijo: ""Creo me he enamorado""
Ella fuma, ella toma
Es diablita, chiquita, pero picosa
Me encanta cuando el pantalón me lo roza
A ella le encanta, se ve en su cara lo goza

Se impregnó el olor de Chanel

Le pones música y solita se excita
Pa' la fiesta nunca se limita
Par de amigas, completa la cuadrilla
Pero tú, mamá, sabes, me mamas
Loca, ven pa'cá, pégate hasta atrás
Nos vamos tú y yo en un viaje fugaz
Interestelar, comerte toda
Fumaremos los dos marihuana
En el cuarto, en la azotea y en mi cama
Nena, creo te llaman, contesta mañana
Que no se apague la llama
En el AMG escuchando ""Ruedas y Cristal""
Quemando veneno que me trae volando, ma
Besito a la Barbie, pa' que baile pega'o

[Verso 1: Zach Bryan]
Um uísque barato vai acalmar minha mente
Toalha de praia estendida no varal
Eu te lembro o seu pai no seu Ford '88?
Labrador com a cabeça pra fora da janela
A areia em seus cabelos está soprando nos meus olhos
Culpe a praia, homens feitos não choram
Você se lembra daquele sofá surrado no porão?
Cantava minhas canções de amor e você me contava sobre
Como sua mãe fugiu e penhorou o anel dela
Eu lembro, lembro de tudo

[Refrão: Zach Bryan]
Um gelo na hora da despedida
Você implorava pra eu ficar até que o Sol nascesse
Palavras estranhas saem
Da boca de um homem feito quando sua mente está acabada
Fotos e matando o tempo
Você só sorri assim quando está bebendo
Gostaria de não lembrar, mas eu lembro
Lembro de cada momento nas noites com você

[Verso 2: Kacey Musgraves]
Você está bebendo sem parar pra acalmar sua mente
Mas quando diabos você vai acalmar a minha?
Você é como pés de concreto no calor do verão
Que queimam como o inferno quando duas almas se encontram
Não, você nunca será o homem que você sempre jurou
Mas me lembrarei de você cantando naquele Ford '88
