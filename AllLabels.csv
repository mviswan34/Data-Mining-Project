Angel Haze - Battle Cry,Money cannot buy All the love thats here tonight All the love thats here tonight Ohoh ohoh Its just you and I So lift your hands toward the sky Lift your hands toward the sky Ohoh ohoh It seems like yesterday that I was nothin Then all of a sudden Im a volcanic eruption Then all of a sudden its like spontaneous combustion And Im all up in your face yelling Bitch you cant tell me nothin Cause I came from the bottom now everybodys watchin I said it was my time now Im who everybodys clockin And Im just out here sprintin Im runnin right through my vision Im trying to outrun my past but still trying to defeat my limits Cause you only get one moment in this life to be great And you give it your all despite what it takes And you never let em kill you you take everything they give you And throw it right fucking at em and tell em it doesnt build you And no it dont ever break you and no it cant overtake you Lifes like a bed of roses you take the thorns and you make do Sometimes you have to hurt for the cause to be reached But one day youll be stronger than all that you beat And you can say You might also like Money cannot buy All the love thats here tonight All the love thats here tonight Ohoh ohoh Its just you and I So lift your hands toward the sky Lift your hands toward the sky Ohoh ohoh I woke up one Sunday morning stopped believing in Jesus Stopped believing in churches I stopped believing in preachers I realized I was a teacher not just one of the heathens Im going to destroy the fallacies start creating believers Start creating the leaders tell them who should they follow Nobody but themselves especially if they hollow Especially when they empty and death reserved for fulfillment You the only person alive that holds the key to your healing So you take it and you run with it And keep going even when your suns hidden Because the time we spend in darkness when the rain come Is where we often find the light soon as the pains done There aint no material things in the world That can change the fact you feel alone Despite the fact that it gets hard you take it all and you still go Take the sun and you still grow lose your light and you still glow I been there Im still here and I know how you feel so Money cannot buy All the love thats here tonight All the love thats here tonight Ohoh ohoh Its just you and I So lift your hands toward the sky Lift your hands toward the sky Ohoh ohoh We dont wanna fight So sing with me a battle cry Sing with me a battle cry Ohoh ohoh Money cannot buy All the love thats here tonight All the love thats here tonight Ohoh ohoh Its hard to explain my way of living to people who never lived it A minute in my position filled with my opposition To anybody not different fighting to stay the same I got lives in my hands and Im fighting to make em change Couldnt accept responsibility find somebody to blame The emotions that Im harboring bout to drive me insane Tried to say Fuck everything but I aint have the heart to Rarely had the heart to do a lot of things I ought to So now I spit it for people who say their cords missing Inspire life into anybody thats forfeiting Cause its easy to keep pretending that theres nothing wrong But its harder to keep your head up and be fucking strong So now they telling me Go Haze they cant stop you Heavyweight flow if they cant lift you then they cant drop you The pinnacle if they cant reach you then they cant top you Man they cant do anything that youre about to Money cannot buy All the love thats here tonight All the love thats here tonight Ohoh ohoh Its just you and I So lift your hands toward the sky Lift your hands toward the sky Ohoh ohoh We dont wanna fight So sing with me a battle cry Sing with me a battle cry Ohoh ohoh Money cannot buy All the love thats here tonight All the love thats here tonightEmbed,<pad> sadness
Angel Haze - Chi ,I need to know That somehow forever is real And we can grow through whatever we feel We could be like rose petals Olympic gold medals Or pretend were kids and run through like every field See it gets much deeper than we think Cause sometimes you dont just fall It gets much deeper and you sink And youre immersed in its love so nothing else seems to matter Though theres wholeness in the moment Its nothing for things to shatter So can we break it down to a science If love is chemistry then you and I could be its ions If love is mostly strength then you and I could be the iron And we carry the weight til it hurts Do anything to make this shit work Cause love wont always be easy I just promise my all when you need it And youd be on time when I need you And wed vow to always be see through cause Theres no progress without some digression And love is boring without some aggression Just believe that you and I are supposed to be together Baby put your hands up and we can reach forever Just believe that you and I are supposed to be together Put your fucking hands up You might also likeI need to know that its possible to love you Like they do it in movies baby I need to know that its possible to feel you Like youre never ever moving I I I see so I believe in you Cause I love the way you do me I I I see so I believe in you Hey baby we can make it make it right I need to know that somehow our destiny matters And that youll keep my heart intact if the rest of me shatters And that the things that we endure well effectively master Baby this is food for thought off of destinys platter See it takes some pain to make it work Although diversion could occur it takes some rock to make it Earth I need to know that Im safe within your grasp And if ever Im off that you would race to keep me on track Cause I would crack the clouds open just to show you heaven And lift you up when you get down just to show you leverage And if youve never felt love Ill make it tangible And show you how to do it right I could be the manual I just believe that you and I are supposed to be together Baby put your hands up and we can reach forever Yeah supposed to be together Put your fucking hands up and we can reach forever I need to know that its possible to love you Like they do it in movies baby I need to know that its possible to feel you Like youre never ever moving I I I see so I believe in you Cause I love the way you do me I I I see so I believe in you Hey baby we can make it make it right I need to know that its possible to love you Like they do it in movies baby I need to know that its possible to feel you Like youre never ever moving I I I see so I believe in you Cause I love the way you do me I I I see so I believe in you Hey baby we can make it make it rightEmbed,<pad> joy

Macklemore - Glorious ,You know Im back like I never left I never left Another sprint another step Another step Another day another breath Another breath Been chasing dreams but I never slept I never slept I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind Seek and I find I can sleep when I die Want a piece of the pie grab the keys to the ride And shit Im straight Im on my wave Im on my wave Get out my wake Im running late what can I say I heard you die twice once when they bury you in the grave And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name So when I leave here on this earth did I take more than I gave Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame Legend its exodus searching for euphoria Trudging through the mud to find the present no ignoring us Got deep off in the street like we some warriors My mama told me never bow your head woo I feel glorious glorious Got a chance to start again I was born for this born for this Its who I am how could I forget I made it through the darkest part of the night And now I see the sunrise Now I feel glorious glorious I feel glorious glorious See Macklemore LiveGet tickets as low as You might also like Im feeling glorious The crib looking Victorian Oh yes it is You know that we been going in Been going in Since we hopped out that DeLorean DeLorean yeah we win En garde things are just things they dont make you who you are Cant pack up a UHaul and take it with you when youre gone We posted on the porch my familys glasses to the stars My grandma smiling down on me like Woo that boy got bars Okay okay yes I do I said amen and hallelujah let me testify too Another morning a morning wont let self get in my way I got my breath I got my faith and I remember why I came woo I feel glorious glorious Got a chance to start again I was born for this born for this Its who I am how could I forget I made it through the darkest part of the night And now I see the sunrise Now I feel glorious glorious I feel glorious glorious We gon be alright put that on my life When I open my eyes hope I see you shine Were planting a flag they dont understand The world is up for grabs Hey hey hey We gon be alright put that on my life When I open my eyes hope I see you shine Were planting a flag they dont understand The world is up for grabs Hey hey hey I feel glorious glorious Got a chance to start again I was born for this born for this Its who I am how could I forget I made it through the darkest part of the night And now I see the sunrise Now I feel glorious glorious I feel glorious gloriousEmbed,<pad> joy
